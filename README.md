# D.S.I.S
Design Structure Implementation Scripts (DSIS) is a tool for automating folder &amp; file creation from designs.

# Inspiration
This idea was inspired from my CSCE 2110 class at UNT where for each of our projects, we had to make a design document with the structure of the files and program. The issue was, it was tedious (or I am just lazy) to actually make & name all the files and folders from the design. So, what if something could do it for you if provided with the design? Thats how I started working on this.
